/*
 * Structures defining a network interface, providing a packet
 * transport mechanism (ala level 0 of the PUP protocols).
 *
 * Each interface accepts output datagrams of a specified maximum
 * length, and provides higher level routines with input datagrams
 * received from its medium.
 *
 * Output occurs when the routine if_output is called, with three parameters:
 *	(*ifp->if_output)(ifp, m, dst, rt)
 * Here m is the mbuf chain to be sent and dst is the destination address.
 * The output routine encapsulates the supplied datagram if necessary,
 * and then transmits it on its medium.
 *
 * On input, each interface unwraps the data received by it, and either
 * places it on the input queue of an internetwork datagram routine
 * and posts the associated software interrupt, or passes the datagram to a raw
 * packet input routine.
 *
 * Routines exist for locating interfaces by their addresses
 * or for locating an interface on a certain network, as well as more general
 * routing and gateway routines maintaining information used to locate
 * interfaces.  These routines live in the files if.c and route.c
